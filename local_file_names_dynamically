# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61404008/how-to-build-up-terraform-local-file-dynamically
#   goal is to create only one file that contains all of the IP addresses.
#  This is very close to one of the examples that are in the Terraform String Templates https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/expressions.html#string-templates 
#  documentation at the time I write this, which we can adapt to your goal like this:

resource "local_file" "ec2_iini" {
  filename = "ec2.ini"
  content = <<-EOT
    %{ for ip in aws_instance.instance.*.private_ip ~}
    ${ip} ansible_ssh_user=ec2-user
    %{ endfor ~}
  EOT
}
